# Eggsweeper

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

## TODO

- [x] "Always guess right": When they expose an egg, check whether anything is knowable. If not, move the egg somewhere that doesn't impact revealed counts.
- - DECLINE. This is more complicated than it sounds. A little demo game like this isn't worthy of it.
- [x] Show count unflagged.
- [x] Visual fanfare on victory.
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Music. 3 songs.
- [x] I don't like the 0-neighbor tile, figure out something nicer. ...darker and intruded, seems to help
