# Eggsweeper

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

## TODO

- [ ] "Always guess right": When they expose an egg, check whether anything is knowable. If not, move the egg somewhere that doesn't impact revealed counts.
- [ ] Show count unflagged.
- [ ] Visual fanfare on victory.
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Music. 2 songs.
- [ ] I don't like the 0-neighbor tile, figure out something nicer.
