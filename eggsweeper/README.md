# Eggsweeper

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

## TODO

- [x] "Always guess right": When they expose an egg, check whether anything is knowable. If not, move the egg somewhere that doesn't impact revealed counts.
- - DECLINE. This is more complicated than it sounds. A little demo game like this isn't worthy of it.
- - [x] On second thought, third I mean, do it. This problem is just too interesting to ignore.
- - ...devilishly tricky. If need be, we could add a special case for the first play. I do think we need at least that.
- [x] Show count unflagged.
- [x] Visual fanfare on victory.
- [x] Sound effects
- [x] Music. 3 songs. Copied the victory music from eggsamples-202408/shmup, and it's not at all appropriate. Meh.
- [x] I don't like the 0-neighbor tile, figure out something nicer. ...darker and intruded, seems to help
