# Egg RPG

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

Skeletal RPG, designed to be copied and hammered into your desired shape.
There's an outer world with scrolling, discrete-space maps.
And formal battles: Pick a move, and outcomes get calculated.

If you want to make something along the lines of Dragon Warrior or Pokemon, this is the place to start.

Shelved 2025-01-14: What we have works more or less, and could be fleshed out without too much effort.
But I'm bored of it already, want to move along.
