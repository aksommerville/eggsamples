# Egg RPG

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

Skeletal RPG, designed to be copied and hammered into your desired shape.
There's an outer world with scrolling, discrete-space maps.
And formal battles: Pick a move, and outcomes get calculated.

If you want to make something along the lines of Dragon Warrior or Pokemon, this is the place to start.

Shelved 2025-01-14: What we have works more or less, and could be fleshed out without too much effort.
But I'm bored of it already, want to move along.

Migrated to Egg v2 2025-12-11. Stubbed out the `string_format` calls because Egg 2 doesn't have an equivalent yet.
