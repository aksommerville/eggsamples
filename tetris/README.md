# Tetris

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

## TODO

- [ ] Game model.
- - Must be encapsulated such that we can run two of the side-by-side.
- - [ ] Tetromino shape analysis.
- - [ ] Falling pieces. Mind that there can be multiple per field.
- - [ ] Line detection and removal.
- - [ ] Termination at the top.
- - [ ] What does it mean that we allow multiple players? Like, what happens when you drop above another falling piece?
- [ ] Menus.
- [ ] Audio.
